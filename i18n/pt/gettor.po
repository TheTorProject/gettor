#~ "Se a sua ligação de Internet bloqueia acesso à rede Tor, pode ser "
#~ "necessário utilizar uma Bridge (ponte). Pontos Bridge são pontos da rede "
#~ "Tor que não estão listados no directório principal. Como não existe uma "
#~ "lista destes pontos, o seu Prestador de Serviços (ISP), não conseguirá "
#~ "bloquear todos os pontos existentes.\n"

#~ "Pode adquirir endereços de pontos bridge (ponte) enviando um email com "
#~ "\"get bridges\" no corpo da sua mensagem para o seguinte endereço:\n"
#~ "bridges@torproject.org\n"
