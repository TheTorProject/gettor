OVERVIEW
--------
GetTor is a program for serving Tor and related files over SMTP. Users interact
with GetTor by sending it email.

The following document explains how to setup GetTor for a server admin.

PREREQUISITES
-------------

To deploy GetTor, you'll want a machine that invokes .forward files
for users. You'll also want to have python (>= 2.5) and rsync installed.

There are some limits with smtp software for outgoing email sizes. You should
check your software to ensure that you can send files that are as large
as the largest files Tor distributes. For postfix, you may want to have a line
that looks like the following in /etc/postfix/main.cf:

    message_size_limit = 50360000

In Exim, the default message size is now 50MB, which should be sufficient. The
value is also adaptable through the config file parameter 'message_size_limit'
in case you need to.

SETUP
-----

This setup descripton presumes that you have access to the latest gettor svn 
trunk somewhere in your local file system.

    gettor@moria:~/tmp$ svn co https://freehaven.net/svn/projects/gettor gettor

After checking out the GetTor source code, you will need to install everything
as follows:

    gettor@moria:~/tmp$ cd gettor/
    gettor@moria:~/tmp/gettor$ python setup.py install

This will copy necessary files to ~/opt/gettor.

Next, configure your ~/.gettorrc file (see "Configuration", below).

After that, you will want to ensure that you have a properly configured set
of mo files for each translation. Generate and install mo files as follows:

    gettor@moria:~/tmp/gettor$ cd ~/opt/gettor
    gettor@moria:~/opt/gettor$ ./GetTor.py -r

You'll see something like this upon success:

    2009-06-21 20:06:01,324 (6136) Installing translation files done.

Once you have everything installed, you'll want to initialize the file store:

    gettor@moria:~/opt/gettor$ ./GetTor.py -fp

You should see an rsync and finally something like:

    sent 1637 bytes  received 415792532 bytes  9558486.64 bytes/sec
    total size is 415735925  speedup is 1.00
    2009-01-05 16:49:29,226 (9222) Syncing Tor packages done.
    2009-01-05 16:49:30,155 (9222) Building packages done.

Now you'll install the cronjob. This clears the blacklist and updates packages 
daily:

    gettor@moria:~/opt/gettor$ ./GetTor.py -i
    2009-01-05 17:34:53,911 (16646) Installing cron donee

Set up a password for package forwarding commands if you wish to use that 
feature:

    gettor@moria:~/opt/gettor$ ./GetTor.py -s seCreTpAssworD

Finally, you need to setup email forwarding to the GetTor bot like so:

    gettor@moria:~$ echo "|/home/gettor/opt/gettor/GetTor.py" > ~/.forward

Now GetTor.py is installed, prepared and ready to serve files. Send it email!

TRANSLATION FILES
-----------------
Provided there is a working locale environment, GetTor will compile and setup
locale files for you as follows:

    gettor@moria:~/opt/gettor$ ./GetTor.py -r
    2009-01-08 12:18:09,041 (19287) Installing translation files done.

You can also configure the .mo files to live in another place by telling GetTor
so in the config file, for example:

    localeDir = /home/gettor/gettor/i18n

This will result in GetTor expecting the English .mo file in the directory

    /home/gettor/gettor/i18n/en/gettor.mo

Also, in case your .po files for some reason live in a different directory
than i18n/ (relative to GetTor.py, as provided by GetTor), you can tell this
to GetTor as follows:

    gettor@moria:~/opt/gettor$ ./GetTor.py -r -d /path/to/my/pofiles/directory

Note that GetTor will expect the same directory structure as provided under
i18n/ in the GetTor source package, e.g. 'i18n/en/gettor.po',
'i18n/de/gettor.po', and so on.

To add a new language to GetTor, one must create a new .po file in subversion
in the proper directory. For Korean, one would create i18n/ko/ and add the
untranslated file (called gettor.po) to that directory. This file should be
translated but partial translations are allowed. Once this file has been
created, the GetTor program does not need to be modified.

However, if a user wished to add support in responses to users, they will need
to modiy the 'requests.py' file like so:

    defaultLang = "en"
    supportedLangs = { "en": "English",·
                       "ko": "Korean",·
                       "de": "Deutsch" }

CONFIGURATION
-------------
A proper GetTor configuration file is expected in the user's home directory
and should look like this:

    gettor@moria:~$ cat .gettorrc
    [global]
    stateDir        = /home/gettor/gettor/state/
    blStateDir      = /home/gettor/gettor/bl/
    wlStateDir      = /home/gettor/gettor/wl/
    distDir         = /home/gettor/gettor/distdir/
    packDir         = /home/gettor/gettor/packdir/
    locale          = en
    logSubSystem    = stdout
    logFile         = /home/gettor/gettor/logs/logfile
    localeDir       =  /home/gettor/gettor/i18n/
    cmdPassFile     = /home/gettor/gettor/pass
    dumpFile        = /home/gettor/gettor/failedmails

You can leave any of these lines out, and it will choose a suitable
default.

Here is what each of them is used for individually:

blStateDir:    Blacklisted (hashed) email addresses go here
wlStateDir:    Whitelisted (hashed) email addresses go here
distDir:       Pristine Tor packages as downloaded by rsync will be found here
packDir:       Processed Tor packages ready to be handed out to the user will
               be found here
srcEmail:      The email containing the Tor package will use this as 'From:'
locale:        Choose your default mail locale
logFile:       If 'file' logging is chosen, log to this file
logSubSystem:  This has to be one of the following strings:
               'nothing':  Nothing is logged anywhere (Recommended)
               'stdout':   Log to stdout
               'syslog':   Log messages will be written to syslog
               'file':     Log messages will be written to a file (Not that
                           this needs the 'logFile' option in the config file
                           also set to something useful
localeDir:     This is where the 'en/LC_MESSAGES/gettor.mo' or
               'whateverlang/LC_MESSAGES/gettor.mo' should go
cmdPassFile:   The file containing the hashed command password
dumpFile:      All failed mails are recorded here

WHAT'S DKIM / WHY DKIM?
-----------------------

People who send mail to gettor need to either use a mail provider that
signs outgoing mail with DKIM, or have their email address or domain
added to the whitelist.

"DomainKeys Identified Mail", aka DKIM, is a mechanism that lets the mail
provider prove that the mail is really coming from the domain and sender
it claims to be from.

Currently GMail and Yahoo both support DKIM, along with other more
esoteric domains like paypal, AOL, earthlink, linkedin, etc. You can
check if your mail provider uses DKIM by examining the headers of emails
you send. If there's a "DomainKey-Signature:" header, then you're in
good shape.

If we didn't check the DKIM signature, people could abuse gettor into
mailbombing innocent email addresses -- one short email resulting in a
15MB attachment sent to an address of their choice is quite an attack
multiplier.

There are a few other alternative options (for example, Microsoft uses its
own proprietary design called 'Sender ID'), but since GMail is already
very common for users in blocked countries, we figured DKIM was a good
starting point.

And last, be aware that the set of domains that technically support
DKIM is probably not exactly the same set that we should recommend for
our users, due to other properties of each mail provider like their
privacy policies.

VALIDATION OF REQUESTED FILES
-----------------------------

When a user submits a successful request, GetTor will respond with an email
that has one attachment. This attachment is a zip file with a .z file
extension. The compressed file currently consists of two files: the requested
tool and a gpg signature from the packager of the respective file.

FILE SIZE ISSUES
----------------

Some email providers may not be happy with the files GetTor sends.
Gmail provides documentation of their incoming and outgoing file sizes. It is
currently 20MB (though we have sent around 21MB without issue):

Other providers are not as transparent and this may cause failures.

SPAM / ABUSE PREVENTION
------------------------------

GetTor does some spam/abuse prevention. This is primarily because we don't want 
to hammer innocent inboxes with huge amounts of tor packages.

First of all, there is a DKIM checker (see "WHAT'S DKIM / WHY DKIM" above) that
prevents GetTor from answering useless spam emails. On top of that, there are 
some hard-coded checks being performed on the sender address. Only mails coming
from yahoo.com.cn, yahoo.com and gmail.com are allowed. However, DKIM checking 
and hard-coded domain checks are currently disabled in GetTor. Mails from all
addresses are being passed to GetTor processing.

On top of that, there is a blacklisting mechanism. It works as follows: Each 
unique email address is allowed to mail GetTor the same type of mail once each
7 days. Mail types are sendDelayAlert, sendPackage, sendPackageHelp, 
sendSplitPackage. Blacklists are stored in the form of hashed email files under
directories. In reality, that looks as follows:

    gettor@moria:~/opt/gettor$ ls -d /home/gettor/gettor/bl/*
        /home/gettor/gettor/bl/general
        /home/gettor/gettor/bl/sendPackage
        /home/gettor/gettor/bl/sendSplitPackage
        /home/gettor/gettor/bl/sendDelayAlert
        /home/gettor/gettor/bl/sendPackageHelp

    gettor@moria:~/opt/gettor$ ls /home/gettor/gettor/bl/sendDelayAlert \
                                                                    | head -n 2
     0154d8584c0afa6290e21098e7ab4cc635b7d50a
     02a33e16feece8671f1274de62de32068a67cf20

In addition to this automatic whitelisting, there is the possibility to add
blacklist entries by hand as follows:

    gettor@moria:~/opt/gettor$ ./GetTor.py -b someone@evil.org

Email addresses that are added this way, go to the general/ directory in the 
blacklist directory.

Besides the blacklisting mechanism, there is a whitelisting mechanism. It works
analogous to the manual blacklisting mechanism:

    gettor@moria:~/opt/gettor$ ./GetTor.py -w someone@evil.org

Whitelisting wins over blacklisting. If a user if blacklisted for X, but also
whitelisted, he will be allowed to do X.
